## Galaxy


Using galaxy to run tools has multiple advantages:
- Direct integration of Cluster computing (usually galaxy instances are using a cluster to run tools)
- Galaxy provides a formal description of the tools and its command-line arguments.

- GaaS uses two way to reuse code in the nuxt ecosystem:
  - Nuxt modules
  - Nuxt layers

integrate third-party services or libraries into a Nuxt project. In this case it will:
