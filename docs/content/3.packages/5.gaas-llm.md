GaaS LLM is a package that provides a simple interface to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs).
It allows you to easily integrate LLMs into your applications, enabling you to perform tasks such as text generation, summarization, translation, and more.
It depends on [GaaS Wiki](/packages/gaas-wiki) to store the LLMs and their configurations.
