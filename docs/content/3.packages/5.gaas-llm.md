GaaS LLM is a chatbot that enables users to ask questions about GaaS Wiki content and bibliography references. 

The package provides a conversational interface where users can query file content and research papers provided by the GaaS Wiki content. 
Under the hood, it implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines the power of Large Language Models with targeted content retrieval 
from the GaaS Wiki knowledge base and bibliography database.

This approach ensures that responses are grounded in accurate, 
up-to-date documentation while leveraging the natural language understanding capabilities 
of modern LLMs to provide contextual and helpful answers.
