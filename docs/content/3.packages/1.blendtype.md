Blendtype is a TypeScript client library for interacting with the [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) REST API. 
It offers strongly typed functions and models to execute workflows on a Galaxy server.
It uses [Effect](https://effect.website/) that let you use type system to track errors and context.
Blendtype can return an effect or a simple promise, if you prefer to avoid using Effect.
Blendtype only supports a subset of Galaxy API endpoints, but it is extensible to support more endpoints as needed.

## Installation

## Usage

### Configuration

Before calling any functions, you first need to initialize the client with Galaxy credentials. To do that, run the function :

```typescript
import dotenv from "dotenv"
import { initializeGalaxyClient } from 'blendtype'

initializeGalaxyClient({ 
  apiKey: process.env.GALAXY_API_KEY, 
  url: GALAXY_URL
})
```

::warning
You shouldn't put your `galaxyApiKey` directly in your code. Instead, use environment variables for example with [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)
::

### Run a workflow

```typescript
import { Effect, Layer } from 'effect'

Effect.gen(function* () {
  const galaxyWorkflowId = "workflow-galaxy-id"
  // Create a Galaxy History
  const galaxyHistory = yield* createHistoryEffect(name)
  // Upload a dataset to the Galaxy History
  const url = "https://example.com/path/to/your/file.txt"
  const filename = "file.txt"
  const historyDataset = uploadFileToHistoryEffect(
    galaxyHistory.id, 
    url, 
    filename
  )
  //Invoke the Galaxy workflow
  const galaxyInvocation = yield* invokeWorkflowEffect(
      galaxyHistory.id,
      galaxyWorkflowId,
      inputs,
      parameters,
    )
  })

```
