GaaS UI is a Nuxt layer built on top of `nuxt-galaxy` that provides pre-built pages and layouts. It simplifies the process of creating a user interface for your Galaxy-based applications 
by offering ready-to-use components and layouts.

It provides a set of pages, components, and layouts to build a user interface 
that consume the `nuxt-galaxy` server API.


- It uses the Galaxy tool description (Galaxy tool xml file or wrapper) 
to generate a form to invoke a workflow.

::warning
Only a subset of the rich Galaxy tool description is supported.
