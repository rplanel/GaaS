## Why a database ?

It would have been possible to avoid using a database in the GaaS packages,
but it would have come with some trade-offs.

Not having a database would mean that the GaaS packages would rely only the Galaxy
database for:

- dataset storage
- authentication
- workflow invocation

this implies to multiplicate the number of requests to the Galaxy API,
which is not ideal for performance and scalability.

User must have an account on the Galaxy instance to use the GaaS packages.

Depend on the Galaxy quota and rate limits.

Could not extend the Galaxy database with custom tables.

## The database

Nuxt Galaxy provides a database layer that is built on top of [Supabase](https://supabase.com/),
which is a powerful open-source backend-as-a-service platform that provides
a PostgreSQL database, authentication, dashboard, file storage, client libraries,
and real-time capabilities.

You can either self-hosted Supabase or use the [Supabase Cloud](https://supabase.com/pricing) service.

GaaS uses the [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) to define and manage database schemas.
