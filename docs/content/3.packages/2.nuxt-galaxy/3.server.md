this Nuxt backend package provides server-side API endpoints to interact
with Galaxy and/or the database.


## Why a backend ?

The authentication to Galaxy can only take place
on the server-side for security reasons: the Galaxy API key needed to access the galaxy
account for this GaaS app should not be exposed to the client-side.

The need for synchronized analysis data and status updates might be more robust if 
made on the server-side

I'm not sure if this is the case
